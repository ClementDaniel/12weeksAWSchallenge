- Amazon Route 53 is a domain name system (DNS) service that provides high availability and low latency for your websites and applications. Amazon Route 53 can route traffic to your applications hosted on AWS or on-premises.\par
- Amazon Elastic Load Balancing (Amazon ELB) is a load balancing service that distributes traffic across multiple Amazon EC2 instances. Amazon ELB can help you improve the performance and reliability of your applications.\par
### Databases\par
- Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a managed relational database service that supports a variety of database engines, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, and MariaDB. Amazon RDS makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud.\par
- Amazon Aurora is a relational database service that combines the performance and availability of high-end commercial databases with the simplicity and cost-effectiveness of open source databases. Amazon Aurora is compatible with MySQL and PostgreSQL.\par
- Amazon DynamoDB is a NoSQL database service that provides single-digit millisecond performance at any scale. Amazon DynamoDB is ideal for mobile, web, gaming, ad tech, and Internet of Things (IoT) applications.\par
### Analytics\par
- Amazon Redshift is a petabyte-scale data warehouse service that makes it easy to analyze all your data using standard SQL. Amazon Redshift provides high performance and low cost for large-scale data analysis.\par
- Amazon Athena is a serverless interactive query service that makes it easy to analyze data in Amazon S3 using standard SQL. Amazon Athena is ideal for ad hoc queries and interactive data visualization.\par
- Amazon Elastic MapReduce (Amazon EMR) is a managed Hadoop framework service that makes it easy to run big data processing frameworks like Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark. Amazon EMR is ideal for large-scale data processing and machine learning workloads.\par
### Machine Learning\par
- Amazon SageMaker is a managed machine learning service that makes it easy to build, train, and deploy machine learning models. Amazon SageMaker provides a variety of pre-built machine learning algorithms and tools to help you get started with machine learning.\par
- Amazon Rekognition is an image and video analysis service that uses deep learning to recognize objects, faces, scenes, and activities in images and videos. Amazon Rekognition can be used to build applications such as image search, facial recognition, and content moderation.\par
- Amazon Polly is a text-to-speech service that uses deep learning to synthesize speech from text. Amazon Polly can be used to build applications such as A talking book app for children,A customer service chatbot for a retail company and A marketing campaign for a new product launch.\par
### Other Core services\par
- Amazon CloudWatch: Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service that collects and tracks data from various AWS resources. It provides insights into resource utilization, application performance, and operational health. CloudWatch is critical for maintaining the health and performance of cloud applications.\par
- AWS Lambda: AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that allows users to run code in response to events without the need to manage servers. Developers can use Lambda to build scalable, event-driven applications and microservices. It is a key component for building serverless architectures.\par
- Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service): Amazon SQS is a fully managed message queuing service that enables decoupling of application components. It provides a reliable and scalable way to transmit any volume of data between distributed systems. SQS is commonly used in applications with high message throughput and processing.\par
- Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service): Amazon SNS is a messaging service that allows users to send messages or notifications to distributed systems and individuals. It can be integrated with other AWS services to automate communication in response to events.\par
## Significance of AWS Core Services\par
### The AWS Core Services play a pivotal role in cloud computing for several reasons\par
- Scalability: AWS Core Services are designed to scale with your needs. You can easily increase or decrease resources to match demand, ensuring that your applications remain responsive.\par
- Reliability: These services are built with redundancy and high availability in mind. AWS data centers are distributed globally, reducing the risk of outages and data loss.\par
